# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

Part 1:
1. Load the data using torchvision
2. Label mapping
3. Building and training the classifier
4. Testing the network
5. Inference for classification
6. Image PreprocessingÂ¶
7. Class Prediction
8. Sanity Checking

Part 2:
1. Train model
2. Predict model
3. Check accuracy
